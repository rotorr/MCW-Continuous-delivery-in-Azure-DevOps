# Continuous delivery in Azure DevOps

Fabrikam Medical Conferences provides conference web site services tailored to the medical community. They started out 10 years ago building a few conference sites for a small conference organizer. Since then, word of mouth has spread, and Fabrikam MedicalConferences is now a well-known industry brand. They currently handle over 100 conferences per year and growing.

Websites for medical conferences are typically low budget web sites because the conferences usually have between 100 to 1500 attendees. At the same time, the conference owners have significant customization and change demands that require turnaround on a dime to the live sites. These changes can impact various aspects of the system from UI through to the back end, including conference registration and payment terms.

The VP of Engineering at Fabrikam, Susan Withers, has a team of 12 developers who handle all aspects of development, testing, deployment, and operational management of their customer sites. Due to customer demands, they have issues with the efficiency and reliability the conference websites. This mainly caused by an inefficient development and operations workflow.

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to setup and configure continuous delivery within Azure and GitHub. You will do this through the use of a new Azure DevOps project, GitHub repository for source control, GitHub actions for continuous delivery and deployment automation, and an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template for Azure resource deployment and configuration management.

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to build templates to automate cloud infrastructure and reduce error-prone manual processes. In addition,  you'll create an ARM template to provision Azure resources, configure continuous delivery with Azure DevOps, and create an Azure DevOps project and Git repository.


### Whiteboard design session
In this whiteboard design session, you will learn how to design a solution with a combination of ARM templates, Azure DevOps, and GitHub actions to enable continuous delivery with several Azure PaaS services.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to build templates to automate cloud infrastructure and reduce error-prone manual processes. In addition, you'll learn how to design a deployment and monitoring architecture using ARM templates to provision Azure resources, Application Insights for deep application monitoring, and GitHub as a source code repository and build/deploy pipeline.

### Hands-on lab
In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to implement a solution with a combination of ARM templates and Azure DevOps to enable continuous delivery with several Azure PaaS services.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to implement solutions for continuous delivery with GitHub in Azure, as well create an ARM template to provision Azure resources, create an Azure DevOps project with a GitHub repository, and configure continuous delivery with GitHub.
